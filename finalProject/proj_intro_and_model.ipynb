    "Our project involves investigating optimal trajectories for moving a cart with an attached pendulum. This project is usually a typical control theory problem, but we are using optimization to investigate the effects of various assumption like small angle approximations and removal of 2nd order terms in solving the trajectory of the cart while minimizing the motor effort. The cart with mass ($m_1$) lays on a frictionless track and can be moved horizontally by control force ($u$). A pendulum with a massless rod (length, $l$) and a bob (mass, $m_2$) is attached to the cart using a frictionless bearing. The cart and the bob will be treated as point masses. The force acting on the cart will also cause the pendulum to swing. Three models with varying complexity will be used to observe the effects of assumptions on the physical dynamics on three different trajectory scenarios.  \n",
    "The three models will increase in complexity due to the decrease in the amount of assumptions:\n",
    "1. Small angle approximation with quazi-static equations. This model will have a quadratic model with linear constraints.\n",
    "2. Small angle approximation. This model will have a quadratic model with quadratic constraints.\n",
    "3. No extra assumptions with full dynamic equations. This model will have a quadratic model with non-linear constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models will aim to minimize the objective function of control force squared when it solves for the control force to move the cart/pendulum through the three trajectory scernarios. All models will have mass, length, state and state derivative (position, velocity, and acceleration) variables for the cart and pendulum. We will use boundary constraints which will limit the initial and final states and state derivatives of the cart and pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "These trajectory scenarios will be swinging the pendulum through the non-inverted positions (rotation of pendulum to a spefic angle?), translation of cart and pendulum while keeping the pendulum in the inverted position, and swing the pendulum from the non-inverted to inverted position (freedom of cart to translate and pendulum to rotate). To verify the solver's ability to estimate the state of the cart and pendulum, a forward euler numerical integrator will also be used. \n",
